## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was the first project I've ever completed and although pretty simple in complexity it was really interesting and challenging. 
I struggled for quite a while with element positioning using Flexbox, but at the end I was able to get the hang of it and create a nice-looking replica of the original design. 
JavaScript had me racking my brain a few times too, specially while developing the rating selection feature. I admit I wasn't able to fully understand how I solved that problem but I will definitely go back to it for a more in-depth analysis.
Overall, I believe it was a fantastic first time experience and I look forward to building more of these awesome projects in the following months.
