## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was the first project I've ever completed and although pretty simple in complexity it was really interesting and challenging. 
I struggled for quite a while with element positioning using Flexbox, but at the end I was able to get the hang of the basics and created a nice-looking replica of the original design. 
JavaScript had me racking my brain a few times too, specially while developing the rating selection feature. Nevertheless, I managed to add all the required functionalities and even created a basic validation feature to avoid users from submiting empty results.
Overall, I believe it was a fantastic first time experience and I look forward to building more of these awesome projects in the following months!

### Continued development

I will definitely keep focusing on learning Flexbox. I spent most of the project's time in trying to position elements correctly. Additionally, I'd very much like to keep focusing on JavaScript by creating more features and internalizing how they work. Finally, I will try to take a look at how to write cleaner code. Although I believe I did a decent job overall, I feel some sections of my project could be rewritten, making them more readable and concise.

### Useful resources

- [A Guide to Flexbox, by Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Super helpful article explaining Flexbox with lots of visual representations.
- [Learning Media Queries in 7 Minutes, by Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU7jJ3NbPdA&t=171s) - A great video from Kyle Cook showing how media queries work with crystal clear examples.
- [Getting Started with GitHub Pages, by The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k) - Not part of the project per se, but this being my first time using Git & GitHub to deploy a piece of work proved to be quite confusing at some points. This video from Shaun Pelling walked me through the steps of setting up my GitHub Pages for the first time ever, which I'm thankful for.
